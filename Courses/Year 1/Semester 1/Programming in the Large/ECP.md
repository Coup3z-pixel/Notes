# Aims and outcomes

Working on large and complex software systems and ensuring those systems remain maintainable requires disciplined, individual practices. Software must be well-specified, well-implemented and well-tested. This course covers concepts and techniques in modern programming languages that help support good practice (such as data abstraction, genericity and exception handling).
Learning outcomes

## Learning Outcomes
- Implement object-oriented programs according to their specifications.
- Test components of object-oriented programs (using a testing framework).
- Write, document and analyse code which uses language features such as inheritance, interfaces, exceptions and I/O.
- Judge whether a program follows good practice.
- Write, interpret and critique specifications for program modules (e.g. classes or interfaces).

### Computer Code
The assignment will also require students to critically look at a given problem and write comprehensive automated tests for your Java program.

### Computer Code
This assignment will provide practice at implementing/reviewing software in Java, as well as, debugging software based on automated test feedback and refactoring 
software to be more maintainable, readable, and re-usable. Additionally, you may be required to write a report on design/implementation decisions you made to improve the 
software.

### Final Exam
The final exam will be an on-campus, invigilated paper-based exam.

The exam has specified materials permitted. One A4 sheet of handwritten or typed notes double-sided is permitted. You may use a Casio fx-82 or UQ approved and 
labelled calculator. Rough paper will be provided.

The exam covers all course materials from the whole semester. Question formats may include multiple choice, short answer and calculations, and programming tasks.
