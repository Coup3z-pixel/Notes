# Relationship Constraints
Relationship constraints limit the possible combination of entities that may participate in the 
corresponding relationship set

A `cardinality ratio` for a relationship set specifies the number of relationships in the set 
that an entity can participate in

e.g. a specific cake cannot be bought by many people
