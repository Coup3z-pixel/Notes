## Prac Exercises
### Description:

You must attend your practicals in-person. For each practical, you will be provided with a task sheet containing relevant tasks, many of 
which are in the style of SCIE1100 exam questions. Some tasks will involve writing Python code.  You will be encouraged to engage in 
discussion with your fellow classmates during practicals.

If you test positive to COVID or are unwell then DO NOT attend your in-person practical. Please email scie1100supertutor@uq.edu.au to 
arrange to attend a different practical that week, or if you are too unwell to attend any practical you may request an exemption by 
including appropriate documented evidence with your request (e.g. a medical certificate).  You can receive at most 3 exemptions per semester.
Students unable to complete sufficient practicals during the semester should consider withdrawing and re-enrolling in a forthcoming semester.

## Philosophy Essay
### Description
This assignment will assess the degree to which students have reached the learning objectives in the philosophy component of SCIE1100, by 
requiring them to write an essay discussing aspects of the scientific method.

### Submission
All assignments must be submitted electronically through Blackboard by the due date and time. If you have a documented reason precluding 
submission, see Section 5.3 about extensions. The plagiarism detection software TurnItIn will be used to check submissions.

## Python Project
### Description
This assignment will assess the degree to which students have reached the learning objectives in the Python and scientific communication 
components of SCIE1100.  Students will develop and demonstrate their skills in writing a Python program, and also demonstrate their ability 
to communicate science in a way which is appropriate for a prescribed target audience.  The assignment will be given within a specific 
scientific context, and students will use scientific information and mathematical models within their Python program.

## Final Exam
### Description
However, you may bring in a single, double-sided sheet of A4 paper containing any information you may 
find useful for the exam.

You will be allowed to bring a UQ approved calculator to the exam.  For more information and UQ policy click here. 

The exam will focus on conceptual questions and problem-solving. It will not require you to write computer programs, but may require you to 
read, modify and interpret computer programs. The exam will be cumulative and may cover topics across the entire course, including the 
philosophy of science component.
