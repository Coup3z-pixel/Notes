# WS1

Suppose that your interest is to `model` and `measure blood flow through the coronary artery`.

Why things must you, as a scientist care about
- ethics
- funding
- Demographic 
- Units
- Sample Size
- Journal Publishing
- Data integrity
- Critical Thinking

## Models
Models are an abstraction of reality based on measured data, to make prediction and evaluate impacts of intervention

Models need to balance between accuracy and complexity

Models can be `physical` or `conceptual`

### Mechanistic model
a model that is derived theoretically by examining the individual physical components of a system

### Phenomoenological models
[!TODO] search in the course notes

## Presentation of Models
- words
- values
- pictures
- mathematics 
- computer programs

Presentation matters on the target audience

# What key physicsal factors would be important in modelling the flow rate
## Assumptions
- Imcompressible
- Cross sectional area is constant
- Uni directional
- no blockages
- make them calm

## Variables
- heart rate
- diameter
- viscosity
- length

## Models as Meditators
models connect multiple areas of knowledge and mediate 

## why are models important
- allows to predict
- makes things meaningful
- helps as understand

# Units of measurements
unit of measurement are an agreed upon standard 

## dimensional analysis
- a method which analyzes the structure of the answer through the final unit of the answer
